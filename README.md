Me and my friends, Seth Doubek, and Vincent Chang have been developing a text-based adventure game titled(informally) [Non-Point and Click](https://github.com/DoubekSeth/NonPointAndClick).

Here is a function map of how the game will work. ![map](https://github.com/DoubekSeth/NonPointAndClick/blob/master/Images/Non-point%20and%20click.png)

And this is an example of a conversation you will have in-game. ![example](https://github.com/DoubekSeth/NonPointAndClick/blob/master/Images/NonPointAndClick.png)
